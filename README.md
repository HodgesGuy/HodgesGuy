### Skills and Projects

#### General

<details>
<summary>4 years of C++ Java coding</summary>
<br>
throughout the 4 years of coding with Java, most of are Java projects were to solve
diffrent problems using mainly loops, conditional statements, algorithms, and math operations.

The objective of this project was to look through diffrent lists to find and printout 
the strings they both shared (duplicates) and numbers not shared (uniques).

#### 1st Year(2019-2020)

<details>
<summary>Used Flowlab to for introduction to coding.</summary>

This is some of the code used to create my game.
The whole purpose of this was to see how code works together to form projects.

<details>
<summary>Worked on engineering projects using Arduinos.</summary>
<br>
One of are Arduino projects was making a water moisture sensor for an atomatic watering system.

The idea was to have a sensor in some soil, when the moisture level was at a specific percent (low)
it would turn on a pump to pump in water and every hour the sensor would check moisture again.

#### 4th Year(2022-2023)

<details>
<summary>Completed the Python Intro Course Certification.</summary>
<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Learned about computers internal structure and how they function.</summary>
<br>
Here we took apart an old computer and talked about each diffrent part and there function, 
after that we were to build it back together from scratch.

We also looked at how to use the BIOS and clear the computer.
